## 🔹 Why & Where Is It Used? (Use Cases)

* **Debugging / Logging**
  Apps can log which Pod they’re in (`MY_POD_NAME`), useful for troubleshooting.

* **Monitoring / Metrics**
  Metrics sidecars (like Prometheus exporters) can tag data with Pod labels/namespace.

* **Multi-tenant Applications**
  A service can know its namespace and enforce multi-tenancy rules.

* **Custom Logging Formats**
  Include Pod labels/annotations in logs without hardcoding.

* **Resource Awareness**
  Apps can adjust behavior based on CPU/Memory limits (`resourceFieldRef`).
  Example: a JVM app setting `-Xmx` based on Pod memory limits.

* **Dynamic Config**
  If you store info in annotations/labels, containers can read them automatically.

* **Legacy Apps**
  Some apps expect an env variable for ID → inject Pod name/UID without rewriting code.
